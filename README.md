# Getting Started on a Next.js weather app project

First your Next Project dependencies ; Next package,Tailwindcss, Axios(if you csn get it to work),autoprefixer,eslint.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Then open [http://localhost:3000] with your browser to see the result.
Start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

# Notes
- I was trying to use the Axios protocol to access my API but ended up using the Fetch standard to access my API.

- Weather API provider : https://openweathermap.org/
